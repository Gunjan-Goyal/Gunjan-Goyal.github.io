This project uses machine learning techniques to analyze and classify images based on their emotional tone, detecting the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of images. <br>
The model uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract features from the images and predict the sentiment. <br>
This project is built using deep learning libraries - TensorFlow and Keras, offering an intuitive and efficient way to understand emotions conveyed in images.<br>

Key Features:
- CNN-based architecture for sentiment analysis.
- A dataset of images labeled with sentiments.
- Model training using TensorFlow/Keras for high performance.
- Evaluation metrics such as accuracy and loss for model performance assessment.

Model Performance:
The model's performance is measured using accuracy (how well the classifier correctly identifies sentiments) and loss (indicating model errors during training). A well-trained model shows high accuracy and low loss, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying emotions in images.
