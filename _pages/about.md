I am Gunjan Goyal, a machine learning enthusiast with deep interest in solving real-world challenges. My expertise are in deep learning, computer vision, and time series analysis, and I’ve had the privilege of developing innovative solutions such as predictive models, intelligent terrain detection systems, and sentiment analysis tools.

I find comfort in the company of cats—their gentle purring always brings me a sense of calm. I’m also a passionate cook, constantly experimenting with new recipes and delving into the rich history of ancient Indian cuisine. And for me, Music lyrics are magical chants :)

Driven by a relentless curiosity and a passion for innovation, I thrive at the intersection of cutting-edge technology, leadership, and societal impact. I am always eager to explore new frontiers and harness the power of AI to create meaningful change.
